# 🔍 Logistic Regression for Binary Outcome Prediction

This project demonstrates how to use **logistic regression** in R to predict binary outcomes based on a combination of numeric and categorical features. Though the example is general, the template is built to be reusable across industries — making it ideal for analysts, data scientists, and consultants working in different domains.

---

## 🎯 Objective

Use logistic regression to model the relationship between a set of predictors and a binary outcome (e.g., success/failure, churn/no churn, purchase/no purchase). This enables data-driven decision-making by quantifying how key variables influence the likelihood of a negative or positive outcome.

---

## 🧪 Methodology

- **Model**: Binary Logistic Regression (`glm` with `binomial` family)
- **Libraries Used**: `tidyverse`, `broom`, `ggplot2`
- **Outputs**:
  - Summary statistics of model coefficients
  - Odds ratios for interpretation
  - Predicted probabilities for each observation
  - Visualizations of key variable impact

## 🗂️ Example Use Cases

This framework can be adapted to:

| Industry         | Example Use Case                                       |
|------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| 🎓 Education      | Predict student failure or dropout based on grades, test scores |
| 🏥 Healthcare     | Predict hospital readmission or disease presence       |
| 🛍️ Retail         | Predict customer churn or purchase conversion          |
| 💼 HR             | Predict employee attrition                             |
| 🧑‍💻 SaaS/Product  | Predict feature adoption or trial-to-paid conversion    |

## 🧹 Data Requirements

- A dataset with:
  - A binary target variable (`1 = negative outcome`, `0 = positive outcome`)
  - Several numeric or factor predictors

> Note: This project uses a synthetic placeholder dataset. Replace with your own data for real-world application.

---

## 📊 Visualizations

The included `ggplot2` graphs demonstrate how predicted probabilities vary based on key input metrics. These can be adapted to surface insights for stakeholders.

---

## 🚀 How to Use

1. Replace `your_dataset.csv` with your actual file
2. Update the predictor columns in the `select()` statement
3. Run the script to fit the logistic regression model and generate predictions
4. Use the model summary and plots to guide decisions
